## Input


`````js
class A {
  d(arguments){ 
    "use strict";
  }
}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`arguments`) as a variable name because: Cannot create a binding named `arguments` in strict mode

start@1:0, error@2:4
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ class A {
 2 ║   d(arguments){
   ║     ^^^^^^^^^------- error
 3 ║     "use strict";
 4 ║   }
 5 ║ }
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
