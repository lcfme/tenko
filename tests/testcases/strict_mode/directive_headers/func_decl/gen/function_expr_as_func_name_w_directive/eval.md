## Input


`````js
f = function eval(b){ 
  "use strict"; 
}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Can not use reserved keyword `eval` in strict mode as id for function that has a use strict directive

start@1:0, error@1:13
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ f = function eval(b){
   ║              ^^^^------- error
 2 ║   "use strict";
 3 ║ }
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`eval`) as a variable name because: Cannot create a binding named `eval` in strict mode

start@1:0, error@1:13
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ f = function eval(b){
   ║              ^^^^------- error
 2 ║   "use strict";
 3 ║ }
╚══╩═════════════════

`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
