## Input


`````js
function foo(p\u0061ckage) { "use strict"; }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Can only declare use strict if func params are "simple"

start@1:0, error@1:43
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ function foo(p\u0061ckage) { "use strict"; }
   ║                                            ^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`p\u0061ckage`) as a variable name because: Keywords may not have escapes in their name and this resolves to `package`

start@1:0, error@1:13
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ function foo(p\u0061ckage) { "use strict"; }
   ║              ^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as strict mode._
