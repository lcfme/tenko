## Input

`````js
async function f(){   (a\u0077ait "sentinal 45334")   }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`a\u0077ait`) as a variable name because: Await not allowed here

start@1:0, error@1:23
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ async function f(){   (a\u0077ait "sentinal 45334")   }
   ║                        ^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`a\u0077ait`) as a variable name because: Await is illegal as var name with module goal

start@1:0, error@1:23
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ async function f(){   (a\u0077ait "sentinal 45334")   }
   ║                        ^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as module mode._
