## Input

`````js
{
  debugger;
}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:3,column:1},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'BlockStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:3,column:1},source:''},
      body: [
        {
          type: 'DebuggerStatement',
          loc:{start:{line:2,column:2},end:{line:2,column:11},source:''}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

tokens (5x):
       PUNC_CURLY_OPEN ID_debugger PUNC_SEMI PUNC_CURLY_CLOSE
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [sloppy][annexb:no]:

````js
{debugger;}
````

Produces same AST
