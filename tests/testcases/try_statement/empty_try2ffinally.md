## Input

`````js
try {} finally {}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:17},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'TryStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:17},source:''},
      block: {
        type: 'BlockStatement',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:4},end:{line:1,column:6},source:''},
        body: []
      },
      handler: null,
      finalizer: {
        type: 'BlockStatement',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:15},end:{line:1,column:17},source:''},
        body: []
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (7x):
       ID_try PUNC_CURLY_OPEN PUNC_CURLY_CLOSE ID_finally
       PUNC_CURLY_OPEN PUNC_CURLY_CLOSE
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

## AST Printer

Printer output was same as input [sloppy][annexb:no]
