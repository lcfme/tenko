## Input


`````js
do let
[] = y
while (a);
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  It is never valid for an expression statement to begin with `let[`, and a `let` declaration would not be valid here

start@1:0, error@1:3
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ do let
   ║    ^^^^^------- error
 2 ║ [] = y
 3 ║ while (a);
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  `let` declaration not allowed here and `let` cannot be a regular var or label name in strict mode

start@1:0, error@1:3
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ do let
   ║    ^^^------- error
 2 ║ [] = y
 3 ║ while (a);
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as strict mode._
