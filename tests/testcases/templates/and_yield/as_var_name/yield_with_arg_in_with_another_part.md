## Input


`````js
x = `1 ${ yield x } 2 ${ 3 } 4`
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  The first token after the template expression should be a continuation of the template

start@1:0, error@1:16
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ x = `1 ${ yield x } 2 ${ 3 } 4`
   ║                 ^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use `yield` outside of generator functions when in strict mode

start@1:0, error@1:10
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ x = `1 ${ yield x } 2 ${ 3 } 4`
   ║           ^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as strict mode._
