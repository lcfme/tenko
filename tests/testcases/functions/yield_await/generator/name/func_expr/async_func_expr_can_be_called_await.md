> This means you can use `await` as a function name as long as you are not in strict mode and not already inside an async function and it's okay if the function whose name is being defined is actually async itself.

## Input

`````js
function *as(){ let f = async function await() { }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`await`) as a variable name because: Await not allowed here

start@1:0, error@1:39
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ function *as(){ let f = async function await() { }
   ║                                        ^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`await`) as a variable name because: Await is illegal as var name with module goal

start@1:0, error@1:39
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ function *as(){ let f = async function await() { }
   ║                                        ^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as module mode._
