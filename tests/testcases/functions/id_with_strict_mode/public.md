## FAIL

## Input

`````js
function public() {
  "use strict";
}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Can not use reserved keyword `public` in strict mode as id for function that has a use strict directive

start@1:0, error@1:9
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ function public() {
   ║          ^^^^^^------- error
 2 ║   "use strict";
 3 ║ }
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`public`) as a variable name because: Cannot use this reserved word as a variable name in strict mode

start@1:0, error@1:9
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ function public() {
   ║          ^^^^^^------- error
 2 ║   "use strict";
 3 ║ }
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as strict mode._
