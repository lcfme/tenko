## Input

`````js
_@_0_0123456789_1_0123456789_2_0123456789_3_0123456789_4_0123456789_5_0123456789_6_0123456789_7_0123456789_8_0123456789_9_0123456789_10_0123456789_11_0123456789_12_0123456789_13_0123456789_14_0123456789_15_0123456789_16_0123456789_17_0123456789_18_0123456789_19_0123456789_20
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Unknown input

start@1:0, error@1:1

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
