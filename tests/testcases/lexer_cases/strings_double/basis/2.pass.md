## Input

`````js
" a " b "
;
" a " b " c "
;
" a ' b "
;
" a ' b ' c "
;
" a ` b "
;
" a ` b ` c "
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
