> The `\u-` is a bad escape and in sloppy mode adds the codepoint for `u` to the char class. So it's basically `v-u`, which is bad (v>u).

## Input

`````js
/[v-\u]/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Unexpected EOF while parsing unicode quad escape; Encountered unescaped closing square bracket `]` while not parsing a character class, which is only valid without u-flag

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /[v-\u]/
   ║ ^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Unexpected EOF while parsing unicode quad escape; A broken `\u` escape can never be valid with u-flag; Encountered incorrect range (left>right, 118 > 117, 0x76 > 0x75) when parsing as if without u-flag

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /[v-\u]/
   ║ ^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode with annexB._
