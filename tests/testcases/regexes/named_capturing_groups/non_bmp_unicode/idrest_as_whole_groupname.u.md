> I think that because RegExpIdentifierName is syntactically not parse-able (because the first character is a number), the whole thing is never "again" parsed as a groupname in webcompat mode. In other words, it never traverses the +N route.

> Since it won't trigger +N, it won't parse a group in webcompat, so it passes as an extended atom.

## Input

`````js
/(?<@{x1d7d0}@>foo)/u
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Tried to parse the name for a capturing group but it contained at least one invalid ident char (`@{xd835}@`)

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /(?<@{x1d7d0}@>foo)/u
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
