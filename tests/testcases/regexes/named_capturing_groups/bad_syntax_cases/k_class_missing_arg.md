# Tenko parser test case

- Path: tests/testcases/regexes/named_capturing_groups/bad_syntax_cases/k_class_missing_arg.md

> :: regexes : named capturing groups : bad syntax cases
>
> ::> k class missing arg
Fails because the named group enables `N` syntax which disallows `\k` as an escape

## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/(?<a>.)\k/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Named back reference \k; missing group name: [47]

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /(?<a>.)\k/
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Named back reference \k; missing group name; Found `\k` in a char class but the regex also had a group name so this is illegal

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /(?<a>.)\k/
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode with annexB._
