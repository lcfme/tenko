## Input

`````js
/[\p{Hex_Digit}]/;
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: The `\p` property escape is only legal with a u-flag, or as a webcompat edge case; Regex contained syntax that is only valid with the u-flag but the u-flag was not present

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /[\p{Hex_Digit}]/;
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:18},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:18},source:''},
      expression: {
        type: 'Literal',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:17},source:''},
        value: null,
        regex: { pattern: '[\\p{Hex_Digit}]', flags: '' },
        raw: '/[\\p{Hex_Digit}]/'
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (3x):
       REGEXN PUNC_SEMI
`````

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode with annexB._

## AST Printer

Printer output was same as input [sloppy][annexb:yes]
