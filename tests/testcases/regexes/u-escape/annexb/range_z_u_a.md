# Tenko parser test case

## Input

`````js
/[z-\u-a]/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Attempted to parse a unicode quad escape but at least one digit was not a hex; Encountered unescaped closing square bracket `]` while not parsing a character class, which is only valid without u-flag

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /[z-\u-a]/
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Attempted to parse a unicode quad escape but at least one digit was not a hex; A broken `\u` escape can never be valid with u-flag; Encountered incorrect range (left>right, 122 > 117, 0x7a > 0x75) when parsing as if without u-flag

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /[z-\u-a]/
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode with annexB._
